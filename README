Gamecollector
================

Hopefully this will be useful as a way to keep track of your video game collection.

Feel free to contribute. Anything helps, even just simple bug reports and suggestions.

That said, here are some opinions that will influence this project:
1. Because I don't want to play sysadmin for a side project, this will be deployed to Heroku. It's just easier this way and will allow me to focus on the app itself.
2. I don't want to deal with resetting passwords or any of the other headaches authentication brings with it, so I'm using OAuth, specifically through Google.
3. I'm using bootstrap because I'm not a graphic designer. If you are a graphic designer, feel free to make a nice theme.
4. I'm going to add features that will benefit the majority. If you want to catalog for which regions you have an instruction manual, this probably isn't going to work out for you. My goal for this is for it to be easily accessible and in my experience providing users with too many options is counter to that goal.

Enjoy!
