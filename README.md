# Gamecollector

## Purpose
I made this side-project to teach me:
* How to use OAuth for user account creation and authentication
* How to integrate with an API

I know the code here isn't the most polished, but the point of this is to expose myself to the topics I listed above.

I hope this will be useful to you as a way to keep track of your video game collection. I use it myself.

## Considerations
* Because I don't want to play sysadmin for a side project, this will be deployed to Heroku. It's just easier this way and will allow me to focus on the app itself.
* I want to keep this simple, so I'm using Google as an authentication source. No need to store passwords.
* I'm using bootstrap because I'm not a graphic designer. I just want to keep everything simple so I can focus on gaining experience in the areas I mentioned previously.
* There's a good chance this won't fit the needs of every video game collector. Functionally, I'm tailoring it to fit my needs. Selfish, I know. For example, I don't care about having the original box art or manuals, so I don't record it. It's as simple as "I have it" or "I don't have it"

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute. Anything helps, even just simple bug reports and suggestions.

Enjoy!
